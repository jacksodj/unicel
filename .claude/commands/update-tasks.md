description: Update tasks and backlog in TASKS.md
---

Update the project tasks and backlog in `docs/TASKS.md`.

I will help you:
1. Read the current state of `docs/TASKS.md`
2. Ask what you want to update:
   - Mark tasks as complete (change `[ ]` to `[x]`)
   - Add new tasks to backlog
   - Update progress counters
   - Reorganize priorities
3. Make the requested changes
4. Update the progress counter at the top
5. Commit the changes with a descriptive message

Task categories:
- **Phase tasks**: Core MLP features
- **Future Backlog**: Post-MLP enhancements
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Interface improvements
- **Advanced Features**: Long-term goals
- **Bug Fixes & Quality**: Issues to address
