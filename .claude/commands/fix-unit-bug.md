description: Launch unit-debugger agent to debug and fix unit conversion issues
---

Launch the **unit-debugger** autonomous agent specialized in unit conversion debugging.

The agent will:
- Ask for details about the conversion bug
- Trace conversion paths and identify root cause
- Implement fixes for exponent/compound unit issues
- Add test cases to verify the fix
- Run tests to ensure no regressions
