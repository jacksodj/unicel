description: Launch unit-debugger agent for deep conversion debugging
---

Launch the **unit-debugger** autonomous agent for detailed conversion path tracing.

Same as /fix-unit-bug but focuses on:
- Step-by-step conversion path analysis
- Manual calculation verification
- Conversion factor accuracy
- Multi-hop conversion chains
- Visual trace of conversion steps

The agent will ask for the specific conversion to debug and provide detailed analysis.
