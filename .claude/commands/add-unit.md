description: Add a new unit to the unit library
---

Add a new unit to Unicel's unit library.

I will help you:
1. Ask what unit to add (e.g., parsec, furlong, BTU)
2. Determine its dimension (length, mass, energy, etc.)
3. Find the conversion factor to a related unit
4. Add it to `src-tauri/src/core/units/library.rs`
5. Add conversion edges in the graph
6. Create test cases in `tests/unit/conversions.rs`
7. Run tests to verify

Provide the unit name and I'll guide you through the process.
