description: Run unit tests and analyze results
---

Run the Rust unit tests for the Unicel project and analyze the results.

Steps:
1. Run: `cargo test --manifest-path=./src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
2. If any tests fail, show the failure details
3. If tests pass, confirm success and show test count
4. Look for any warnings or deprecation notices
5. Suggest fixes for any failing tests
