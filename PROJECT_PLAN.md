# Unicel - Project Plan & Task Tracking

## MLP (Minimum Lovable Product) Strategy

The MLP focuses on delivering the core innovation with enough polish to be genuinely useful and demonstrate the value proposition.

### MLP Success Criteria

**User can:**
1. Create a workbook with unit-aware cells
2. Enter values with units (e.g., "100 USD", "5 meters")
3. See automatic unit conversion (Metric â†” Imperial toggle)
4. Write formulas that preserve units (e.g., `=A1*2` where A1=100ft â†’ 200ft)
5. Experience automatic unit cancellation (e.g., `100mi / 2hr â†’ 50 mi/hr`)
6. Save and load workbooks
7. Get helpful warnings for incompatible operations
8. Export to Excel for sharing

**NOT included in MLP:**
- SQL queries (can be added later)
- MCP integration (Phase 2)
- Complex UI features (Phase 2)
- Advanced conversion modes (As of Date, etc.)
- Custom units (Phase 2)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Risk:** Performance issues with large workbooks
  - **Mitigation:** Start with 1000 cell limit, optimize later

- **Risk:** Complex unit parsing edge cases
  - **Mitigation:** Use simple whitelist for MLP, expand later

- **Risk:** Cross-platform build issues
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on macOS first, Windows/Linux after MLP

### Scope Risks
- **Risk:** Feature creep
  - **Mitigation:** Strict MLP scope, defer everything else

- **Risk:** Over-engineering
  - **Mitigation:** Simple implementations first, refactor later
