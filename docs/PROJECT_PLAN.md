# Unicel - Project Plan & Task Tracking

## MLP (Minimum Lovable Product) Strategy

The MLP focuses on delivering the core innovation with enough polish to be genuinely useful and demonstrate the value proposition.

### MLP Success Criteria

**User can:**
1. Create a workbook with unit-aware cells
2. Enter values with units (e.g., "100 USD", "5 meters")
3. See automatic unit conversion (Metric â†” Imperial toggle)
4. Write formulas that preserve units (e.g., `=A1*2` where A1=100ft â†’ 200ft)
5. Experience automatic unit cancellation (e.g., `100mi / 2hr â†’ 50 mi/hr`)
6. Save and load workbooks
7. Get helpful warnings for incompatible operations
8. Export to Excel for sharing

**NOT included in MLP:**
- SQL queries (can be added later)
- MCP integration (Phase 2)
- Complex UI features (Phase 2)
- Advanced conversion modes (As of Date, etc.)
- Custom units (Phase 2)

## Example Workbooks for MLP Launch

The three use case example workbooks will demonstrate real-world applications of the unit-aware system to new users. These simplified versions focus on core functionality (no MCP, no live data) but show the key value propositions.

### 1. Construction Estimator (`construction-estimator.usheet`)

**Purpose:** Show dimensional analysis and automatic unit handling

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- **Area calculations:** `18ft * 9ft = 162 sqft` (automatic unit multiplication)
- **Volume calculations:** `450 sqft * 4in = 150 cuft` (dimension handling)
- **Unit cancellation:** `935 sqft * $4.80/sqft = $4,488` (sqft cancels)
- **Waste factors:** `850 sqft * 1.10 = 935 sqft` (dimensionless multipliers)
- **Metric/Imperial toggle:** Show same materials in feet vs meters
- **Mixed units:** `18ft 6in` properly handled

**Sample Data:**
```
Sheet: Material Estimate
â”œâ”€ 2x4 Studs: 145 pieces @ $4.25/piece = $616.25
â”œâ”€ Drywall: 42 sheets @ $12.75/sheet = $535.50

- **Unit cancellation:** `2000 GB/mo * $0.085/GB = $170/mo` (GB cancels)
- **Nested compound units:** `50M requests/mo * $0.20/M requests = $10/mo`
- **Multi-region pricing:** EUR vs USD with conversion factor
- **Per-unit cost calculations:** `$550.66/mo / 10,000 users = $0.055/user/mo`

2. **Add notes/comments:** Explain what each formula demonstrates
3. **Visual polish:** Use cell colors to highlight key calculations
4. **Progressive complexity:** Start with simple formulas, build up
5. **Show errors:** Include 1-2 examples of incompatible unit warnings
6. **Documentation:** Each workbook should have a "README" sheet explaining it

- **Risk:** Complex unit parsing edge cases
  - **Mitigation:** Use simple whitelist for MLP, expand later

- **Risk:** Cross-platform build issues
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on macOS first, Windows/Linux after MLP

### Scope Risks
- **Risk:** Feature creep
  - **Mitigation:** Strict MLP scope, defer everything else

- **Risk:** Over-engineering
  - **Mitigation:** Simple implementations first, refactor later

---

## Success Metrics

**MLP Success:**
- Can handle 1000+ cells
