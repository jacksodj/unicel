- File synchronization is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service

## Third-Party Services

Unicel Viewer does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

Unicel Viewer does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13 years of age. The app is suitable for all ages (4+) as it contains no objectionable content.

## Data Security
